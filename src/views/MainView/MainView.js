      <h2>Dr. Hadlock's Tip of the month:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Sciatica - a term often misused - is characterized by pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in the thigh, lower leg or foot and is a result of
        compression of all or part of the sciatic nerve which originates in the low back. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and
        extends from the low back down both legs into the feet. Symptoms can sometimes be felt along the entire path of the nerve, but often present
        only along certain spots along its path (depending on where the nerve is being compressed). For example, it is not uncommon to experience an
        irritating ache in the back of the thigh or the outside edge of a calf only. One would think the pain or other symptoms would be along the
        entire course of the nerve, but our nerve system does not always convey signals in this fashion. The key to successfully eliminating the
        sciatica is to remove the pressure that is being placed on the nerve. Depending on the location of the impingement, what is causing the nerve
        pressure as well as severity of this compression will all be factors which will have a bearing on a doctors decision about how to remedy the
        problem.

        Although there a number of factors to consider, my primary tool for addressing sciatica include hands on spinal adjustments which provide a
        number of benefits to the affected area including the restoration of mechanical mobility in a particular joint, increase in fluid transfer in
        and around the joint, potential endorphine release and ultimately the elimination of nerve compression. Other components of treatment provided
        are various forms of therapy which may include gentle massage, neuromuscular therapy, deep tissue massage, trigger point therapy, passive
        stretching techniques as well other treatment modalities.
